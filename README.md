# TouchGrass (WIP)
A web extension that you can use to time your YouTube usage and to control under what hours can you "doom-scroll" it.
The current goals of this project is to only disable the home page of YouTube, since that's where the most distraction happens. Allowing you to search will always be open.

Currently, it's only tested to work on Firefox, though Chromium support should be trivial.

# Goals
1) Get till the proof-of-concept stage (add the ability to lock YouTube homepage for a certain duration during the day, and settings for which is only changeable by a password) [IN PROGRESS]
2) Implement basic usage statistics. [IN PROGRESS]

# Would be nice to have
1) Categorically remove videos from appearing on your homepage (maybe only blacklist gaming videos, or only whitelist development related videos?)
