/**
 * Currently I've decided to update the watch time every minute.
 * Of course this means the watch time is always off by a maximum of 1 minute.
 * Another alternative would be to have a `start_recording` function
 * that just simply logs in the current time, and a `stop_recording()` function
 * that is somehow called when the page is closed (maybe some "run_at" attribute in manifest.json).
 * The reason I've decided not to do that:
 * - I'd need to add yet another JS binding file because ManifestV2 can't directly
 * call into .wasm (afaik) and needs a glue JS file; which will then call into a disjointed Rust file,
 * which would need to be included in the module (for LSP to work).
 * but wouldn't actually be related to the functioning of the module. This incrementally
 * makes the project feel more confusing when files are grouped together not by functionality
 * but by nature of language.
 * An alternative that I've not explored is if there's a way to do it at runtime (not describing it in manifest.json)
 * but rather programmtically via Rust code only. Then, I can bypass JS glue code.
